## Executive Summary 

### Research Purpose 
This report’s main objective is to investigate the engagement patterns of cities in the United States of America with the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). By conducting an econometric analysis, it 
aims to identify the determinants of cities to 1) sign up to the UNFCCC and 2) undertake actions recorded by the 
UNFCCC. Insights from this analysis can inform policy decision-making, help cities benchmark their climate 
engagement and act as a reference for similar analyses. 
### Research Design 
The United States of America was chosen as the country of focus. The US’ active participation in the UNFCCC, the 
abundance of high-quality data available, and the interesting political landscape with climate change being a divisive 
issue facilitate a thorough analysis. The potential determinants of UNFCCC engagement cover demographic, 
economic, climate change and political features. The analysis leverages statistical techniques such as logistic regression 
and random forest classification to assess significance, feature importance and explanatory power. 
### Research Limitations 
During this research, several issues limited the effectiveness and validity of the analysis conducted. The number of 
cities in the US signed up to the UNFCCC meant the sample size for several models was small, which potentially 
caused problems surrounding statistical testing and model inference. Despite the large amount of data available, when 
the desired level of granularity was not available county-level variables were used in place of city-level data. This 
analysis attempted to use a comprehensive set of variables that could explain the variation in UNFCCC engagement, 
however, there is the possibility of omitted-variable bias leading to distorted results.   
### Findings 
Research question 1 concerned the determinants of cities to sign up for the UNFCCC. Demographic features saw that 
population had a significantly positive impact and the highest feature importance, median age and education level had 
significantly negative effects, and ethnic diversity not having any significant influence but having the second highest 
feature importance. In terms of climate change variables, all had bottom four feature importances, emissions per capita 
had a significantly negative effect, the number of natural disasters had a significantly negative effect, and the land 
temperature trend was insignificant. The economic indicators unemployment rate and poverty proportion had 
significantly negative and positive effects respectively, and median household income was insignificant. Political 
affiliation significantly influenced signing up to the UNFCCC but ranked lowest in feature importance. 

Research question 2 explored the determinants of cities to undertake actions tracked by the UNFCCC. Once again in 
the demographic features, population was largely positively significant and highly ranked in feature importance, 
median age and education level were also significant, and ethnic diversity was insignificant but had high feature 
importance. The climate change variables were largely insignificant and had low feature importance. Out of the 
economic indicators median household income was positively significant in most models and had the highest feature 
importance. The presence of a Republican majority was insignificant in most models and had the lowest feature 
importance in all random forests.  
### Research Implications 
In research question 1, it was concluded that cities with larger, younger and more educated populations are more likely 
to sign up for the UNFCCC. The same can be said for cities more exposed to the immediate effects of climate change. 
The economic prosperity of cities may influence UNFCCC engagement, given the negative relationship between the 
unemployment rate and signing up for the framework. The significance of a Republican majority illustrated that the 
partisan divide in the perception of climate change is also present in city UNFCCC engagement. 
Population exhibited consistent explanatory power across the actions examined in research question 2, with larger, 
younger, more educated cities being more likely to undertake UNFCCC actions. The climate change features had 
minimal influence, which is potentially due to the state-level granularity of those variables. Unlike in research question 
1, cities with higher median household income were significantly more likely to engage with the UNFCCC. The 
political affliction of a city proved to be ineffective in explaining the nuances of the individual actions recorded by the 
UNFCCC.  

This report can hold significance for the UNFCCC, highlighting areas of focus for improving engagement among cities 
unlikely to participate. The findings also point to the need for further research and the possibility of exploring more 
variables and countries.
